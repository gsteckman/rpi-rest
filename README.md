# rpi-rest
rpi-rest provides a REST interface for the [Raspberry Pi][1] GPIO with [SmartThings][2] integration. The REST interface is written in [Java][4] and leverages the [Spring Framework][3] and [The Pi4J Project][5]. A SmartApp and DeviceHandler provide the integration between the SmartThings app on your phone and the REST interface running on the Raspberry Pi. The REST interface can be used without SmartThings, but the SmartThings integration requires the REST interface.
